### Covid-19 Data Analsis Project

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using Python, SQL, and Tableau. The analysis includes data manipulation, cleaning, modeling, correlation analysis, and predictive modeling using linear regression and random forest regression algorithms. Additionally, Tableau visualizations are created to showcase global numbers, total deaths per continent, percent population infected, and percent population infected per country.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies and libraries were used in this project:

- Python: For data manipulation, cleaning, and modeling
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy: For numerical operations
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forest regressor)
- SQL: For querying and manipulating data stored in databases
- Tableau: For data visualization and interactive dashboards

## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps included:

- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Feature selection and engineering
- Data transformation and normalization

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis was performed to gain insights into the data and identify patterns and trends. This included:

- Descriptive statistics
- Correlation analysis
- Visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, line plots, histograms)

## Modeling and Prediction
Linear regression and random forest regression models were trained and evaluated to predict future COVID-19 cases and deaths. The steps included:

- Train-test split
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared)

## Visualizations
Tableau was used to create interactive visualizations and dashboards to communicate the findings effectively. The visualizations included:

- Global COVID-19 numbers (cases, deaths, death percentage)
- Total deaths per continent
- Percent population infected worldwide
- Percent population infected per country
